# lost-and-found-system_task1
Concept: 
A simple system that helps users log and retrieve information about lost and found items within a school, office, or community. It mimics real-world information systems used for inventory and tracking but keeps it light and engaging. 
Technical Steps 
Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment 
· Self explanatory 
Step 2: Define the Data Structure 
· Use a list of dictionaries OR a simple database (CSV/JSON/SQLite) to store item details. 
· Each record will include: 
· Item ID (unique identifier) 
· Item Name (e.g., “Red Backpack”, “Wireless Earbuds”) 
· Category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books) 
· Location Found (e.g., Library, Cafeteria) 
· Date Found 
· Claimed Status (Yes/No) 
Step 3: Implement Data Entry (Report a Found Item) 
· Allow users to input lost and found item details. 
· Validate entries (e.g., prevent duplicate item IDs). 
· Store in the data structure. 
Step 4: Implement Search & Retrieval (Find Lost Items) 
· Enable users to search items by category, location, or item name. 
· Display results in a structured format. 
Step 5: Implement Claiming an Item 
· If a user finds their lost item, allow them to mark it as claimed. 
· Update the database to reflect the status change. 
Step 6: Implement a Simple Menu 
· Present options like: 
1. Report a Found Item 
2. Search for a Lost Item 
3. View All Unclaimed Items 
4. Claim an Item
5. Exit Program 
Step 7: Test the System 
· Add multiple test cases for found and lost items. 
· Ensure searching and claiming functions work correctly. 
Preferred Enhancements 
· Gamification : Assign a small reward (e.g., "Points") for reporting lost items. · Add a Timer: If an item is unclaimed for a long time, move it to an "auction" mode. · Use a Simple GUI: Self explanatory. 
· Add AI/Random Responses: Make the system suggest the most common lost items based on input trends.
